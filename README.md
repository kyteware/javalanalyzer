# Javalanalyzer

My term project will be to build a tool that can parse java code and visualize it using various kinds of graphs. It will be able to take a project existing on a user's computer and generate package diagrams and class diagrams for it. It is intended to be used by developers who want to analyzer their code.

I am choosing this project because I am interested in programming languages and visualization, and this project incorporates both of those in an interesting and challenging way.
